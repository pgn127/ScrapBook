# ScrapBook
2nd app - iOS

This app creates a Scrapbook that is split into different colllections with an option to see all clippings. A "Clipping" is a piece of information that you'd like to save into the scrapbook. This can include an image and text description. 
Clippings may be organized into groups called "Collections". You could have one collection for recipes and another for holidays.
